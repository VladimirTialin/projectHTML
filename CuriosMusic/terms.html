                    defined in the Triller.co Terms of Service
                    (“Platform Terms”) set forth here.[1] The Platform Terms are incorporated by reference into these
                    NFT Terms, and govern your use and access of the NFT Platform. In the event of a conflict between
                    these terms of these NFT Terms and the Platform Terms, the NFT Terms will supersede and control.

                    will have the meaning set forth in the Platform Terms. For the purposes of these NFT Terms, the
                    following capitalized terms will have the following meanings:
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">“Company NFT” means an NFT (as defined below) that is sold
                    directly by or on behalf of Company through the NFT Platform, and that is associated with certain
                    Content (as defined below) made available by Company.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">“Content” means content, materials, art, design, and drawings
                    (in any form or media, including, without limitation, video or photographs).
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">“NFT” means a non-fungible token implemented on a blockchain
                    using smart contracts, such as a non-fungible token conforming to the ERC-721 standard on the
                    Ethereum blockchain network. The NFT is separate and distinct from the Content or any other Third
                    Party IP with which it may be linked or associated.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">“Third Party IP” means any third party copyrights, trade
                    secrets, trademarks, know-how, patent rights or any other intellectual property rights recognized in
                    any country or jurisdiction in the world.

                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">The NFT Platform allows you to bid on, purchase and otherwise
                    transact in Company NFTs. Any Company NFT that you acquire on the NFT Platform is not hosted or
                    stored by Company, but will be in your possession such as in your designated cryptocurrency wallet,
                    and your ownership of the Company NFT will recorded on the applicable blockchain. Company has no
                    obligation or liability to you for keeping, storing, or helping you recover any Company NFT that you
                    purchase hereunder.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">“Company NFT” means an NFT (as defined below) that is sold
                    directly by or on behalf of Company
                    through the NFT Platform, and that is associated with certain Content (as defined below) made
                    available by Company.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">When you purchase a Company NFT, you own the NFT but you do
                    not own any intellectual property rights in the Content except for the license grants expressly set
                    forth herein.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">In certain instances, a purchase of a Company NFT may come
                    with a commitment by the Company that the Company NFT will be “one of a kind” or a similar
                    designation (“Unique NFT”). In such an instance, Company commits that it will not sell any other NFT
                    featuring the same Content as associated with such Unique NFT. Company will also provide you such
                    documentation as determined by Company that attests that Company has not sold or distributed or
                    otherwise made available any other NFT that is associated with the same Content as associated with
                    your Unique NFT.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">For clarity, Company does not represent, warrant or guarantee
                    that others have not created or downloaded their own copies of such Content (including via
                    unauthorized ripping or downloading of such Content), or that others will not attempt to sell their
                    own NFTs featuring such Content. Company has no obligation or liability to take down such other NFTs
                    featuring such Content. Further, the foregoing does not restrict the Company from selling other
                    Content of the same event as featured in any Unique NFT, as long as such other Content is different
                    from the Content of the Unique NFT (e.g., different clip length, camera angle, background music,
                    etc.).

                    subject to your compliance with these NFT Terms, Company hereby grants you a worldwide,
                    non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free license to use, copy, and display the Content for such
                    purchased Company NFT, solely for the following purposes: (a) for your own personal, non-commercial
                    use; (b) as part of a marketplace that permits the purchase and sale of your Company NFTs, provided
                    that the marketplace cryptographically verifies each Company NFT’s owner’s rights to display the
                    Content for their Company NFT to ensure that only the actual owner can display the Content; or (c)
                    as part of a third party website or application that permits the inclusion, involvement, or
                    participation of your Company NFT, provided that the website/application cryptographically verifies
                    each Company NFT’s owner’s rights to display the Content for their Company NFT to ensure that only
                    the actual owner can display the Content, and provided that the Content is no longer visible once
                    the owner of the Company NFT leaves the website/application. This license only lasts as long as you
                    are the valid owner and holder of the Company NFT associated with the licensed Content. If you sell
                    or transfer the Company NFT to another person, this license will transfer to such other owner or
                    holder of the Company NFT, and you will no longer have the benefits of such license.
                </p>

                    title and interest in and to the NFT Platform and Content, throughout the world, in perpetuity. The
                    Content and all intellectual property rights in and to the NFT Platform are considered “Platform IP”
                    as set forth in the Platform Terms.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">When you purchase a Company NFT, you own the NFT but you do

                    or attempt to do any of the foregoing without our (or, as applicable, our licensors’) express prior
                    written consent in each case: (a) modify the Content for your Company NFT in any way, including,
                    without limitation, the shapes, designs, drawings, attributes, or color schemes; (b) use the Content
                    for your Company NFT to advertise, market, or sell any third party product or service; (c) use the
                    Content for your Company NFT in connection with images, videos, or other forms of media that depict
                    hatred, intolerance, violence, cruelty, or anything else that could reasonably be found to
                    constitute hate speech or otherwise infringe upon the rights of others; (d) sell, distribute for
                    commercial gain (including, without limitation, giving away in the hopes of eventual commercial
                    gain), or otherwise commercialize merchandise that includes, contains, or consists of the Content
                    for your Company NFT; (e) attempt to trademark, copyright, or otherwise acquire additional
                    intellectual property rights in or to the Content for your Company NFT; or (f) otherwise utilize the
                    Content for your Company NFT for your or any third party’s commercial benefit.

                    Third Party IP (e.g., licensed intellectual property from any rights holder, such as music
                    performance rights or publicity rights), you understand and agree as follows: (a) that you will not
                    have the right to use such Third Party IP in any way except as incorporated in the Content for your
                    Company NFT, and subject to the license and restrictions contained herein; (b) that, depending on
                    the nature of the license granted from the owner of the Third Party IP, we may need to (and reserve
                    every right to) pass through additional restrictions on your ability to use the Content; and (c) to
                    the extent that we inform you of such additional restrictions in writing, you will be responsible
                    for complying with all such restrictions from the date that you receive the notice, and that failure
                    to do so will be deemed a breach of the license contained herein.

                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">The Company NFTs may be sold by Company as part of an
                    auction. You will be permitted to submit bids for a Company NFT through the NFT Platform or such
                    other means that Company designates in its sole discretion. You must pay for the purchase via the
                    currency set forth by Company, which may be in dollars or cryptocurrency. Company may set minimum
                    bid amounts for any Company NFT auction.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">“Company NFT” means an NFT (as defined below) that is sold
                    directly by or on behalf of Company
                    through the NFT Platform, and that is associated with certain Content (as defined below) made
                    available by Company.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">As soon as you place and confirm your bid amount, you agree
                    that you may not, under any circumstances, amend, retract or revoke your bid. Company is not
                    responsible for any errors made in your bidding. Company reserves the right, in its sole and
                    absolute discretion to reject, revoke or refuse to accept any bid (even those that have been
                    previously accepted); to withdraw any Company NFT from being eligible for purchase, whether during
                    or after the sale, including for failing to meet any reserve prices; to restart or continue the
                    bidding even if the bidding has finished; or in the case of error or dispute and whether during or
                    after the sale, to continue the bidding, determine the successful bidder, cancel the sale of the
                    lot, or re-offer and re-sell any lot. If any dispute relating to bidding arises during or after the
                    sale, Company’s decision in exercise of this option is absolute and final.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">Bids may only be submitted between the dates and times
                    specified for that Company NFT, or as otherwise permitted by Company in its sole discretion.
                    However, Company may extend the bidding window to always ensure a buffer period (such as five
                    minutes) exists between the last bid and closing time of that bidding window. These extensions may
                    continue indefinitely until there is no more bidding activity on the Company NFT for such designated
                    period.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">The purchase price of any auction will include the hammer
                    price and the buyer’s premium (in the case of a sale by auction) or a “Buy Now” price if that is
                    offered by the Company, as well as any all shipping and related costs and charges, any applicable
                    duties, goods, sales use, compensating or service tax or VAT.
                </p>
                <p class="text text__t14 text__t14_normal">Company may provide a “Buy Now” feature that allows you to
